#On a chessboard, fields are marked with a letter between a and h for the column and a number between 1 and 8 for the row. 
Given a position string, print the color of the field (white or black)

# On a chessboard, positions are marked with letters between a and h for the column and a
# number between 1 and 8 for the row. The first place on the board, a1, is black. The next
# is white, alternating across a row. Odd rows start with black, even rows start with white.

# Give a 2 character input string with a letter (a-h) and a number (1-8), print "Black" or
# "White" indicating if the square is black or white.

inputStr = 'a1' 
v="abcdefgh"
a=v.find(inputStr[0])
if ((int(a)+1)%2!=0 and int(inputStr[1])%2==0):
   print("White")
elif (int(a)+1)%2==0 and int(inputStr[1])%2!=0:
   print("White")
else:
   print("Black")
